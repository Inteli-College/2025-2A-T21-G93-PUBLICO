# MIA — Travel Finance Management via WhatsApp
Started in 02/08/2025

## Project Overview

MIA proposes a new approach to personal finance management during travel by embedding expense tracking into a familiar messaging platform. Instead of relying on complex applications or manual spreadsheets, users interact naturally through WhatsApp, sending messages, voice notes, or photos of receipts.

The project combines:
- Conversational interfaces  
- Artificial intelligence (NLP, OCR, Speech-to-Text)  
- Cloud-based backend architecture  
- Privacy-first design aligned with LGPD  

---

## Status

The project currently includes:
- Validated problem and market fit  
- Defined business model and value proposition  
- Implemented functional application (MVP)  
- Academic and public documentation completed  

Future work includes scalability improvements, group expense management, and integrations with financial and travel services.

This repository contains the academic and technical documentation of **MIA**, a fintech project developed as part of the *Inteli Empreendedor* program. MIA is a WhatsApp-based conversational system designed to simplify personal financial control during travel through multimodal interaction (text, audio, and images).

The repository is structured to clearly separate **public reports**, **business documentation**, **technical deliverables**, and **academic submissions**.
