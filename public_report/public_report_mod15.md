# Public Report — MIA Startup Development  
**Travel Expense Management via WhatsApp**

## Introduction

This public report presents the progress and main results achieved during the initial development phases of **MIA**, a fintech startup focused on managing personal finances during travel through a WhatsApp-based conversational interface. The project aims to reduce common friction points in travel expense management by offering a simple, intuitive experience integrated into a platform already widely used by users.

The work was structured into five main stages, ranging from market research and strategic definition to prototyping and initial validation, culminating in the development of the business plan.

## 1. Market Research and Benchmarking

The first stage consisted of an in-depth analysis of the personal finance and expense management market, with a particular focus on solutions designed for individual users and travelers. Existing products were analyzed at both national and international levels, including personal finance applications, Open Finance–based solutions, and corporate expense management tools.

The benchmarking process revealed that most existing solutions are highly complex, rely on dedicated mobile applications, and require continuous manual input, which significantly reduces user adoption—especially during travel. In parallel, recurring user pain points were identified, such as forgetting to register expenses, difficulty categorizing costs across multiple currencies, and lack of real-time financial visibility.

As an outcome of this stage, a SWOT analysis was conducted, highlighting WhatsApp integration and ease of use as key strengths, while identifying the low adoption of conversational solutions in the travel finance segment as a major opportunity. An initial project plan (“high-level plan”) was also produced, consolidating scope, objectives, and strategic direction for subsequent phases.

## 2. Target Audience, Value Proposition, and Project Structure Definition

Based on insights from the market research, the second stage focused on clearly defining the target audience and MIA’s value proposition. Two to three detailed personas were developed, representing users who travel frequently, rely heavily on WhatsApp, and show low tolerance for complex financial tools.

In addition to persona definition, the main priority use cases were mapped, such as real-time expense registration, on-demand financial summaries, and expense organization by trip. The project’s mission was formalized as making travel financial control accessible, intuitive, and barrier-free, while the main objective became the creation of a simple financial habit seamlessly integrated into users’ daily routines.

This stage resulted in the creation of a complete Value Model Canvas, covering target customers, value proposition, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, and cost structure. The canvas consolidated the project’s strategic vision and served as the foundation for product and technology decisions.

## 3. Features and Requirements

During the third stage, initial ideas were translated into structured requirements, enabling a more concrete definition of the product. Features were divided into two main groups: those required for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and those planned for a future backlog.

Functional requirements included trip creation, expense registration via text, voice, or images, automatic categorization, and summary generation. Non-functional requirements addressed performance, security, scalability, and compliance with data protection regulations such as LGPD. To support prioritization, a MoSCoW matrix was created, classifying features as *Must have*, *Should have*, *Could have*, or *Won’t have* in the initial release.

The key outcome of this stage was a clear and prioritized feature list, enabling focused development of a lean yet functional MVP aligned with real user needs.

## 4. Architecture and User Flows

The fourth stage focused on technical planning and user experience design. A service-oriented architecture was defined, with WhatsApp as the primary interface, an automation layer for conversational flow orchestration, a backend responsible for data persistence and processing, and integrations with external APIs for OCR, NLP, and currency conversion.

In parallel, the main user interaction flows within WhatsApp were mapped, from conversation initiation to expense registration and report requests. These flows were documented through diagrams, ensuring clarity about system behavior and facilitating both development and future validation.

Deliverables from this stage included a technical architecture document and conversational interaction flow diagrams, which serve as references for implementation and system evolution.

## 5. Navigable Prototype and Validation

In the fifth and final stage of this delivery, a navigable prototype was developed in Figma to partially simulate MIA’s WhatsApp-based user flow. The prototype enabled testing of interaction logic, validation of message clarity, and collection of early feedback from potential users.

Based on user interactions and observations, the feature backlog was reviewed and updated, refining priorities and identifying opportunities to improve user experience. In parallel, the project’s business plan was consolidated, incorporating insights from previous stages, market sizing estimates, monetization strategy, and initial financial projections.

## Conclusion

By the end of these five stages, the MIA project established a solid foundation from both strategic and technical perspectives. The problem was validated, the target audience clearly defined, the value proposition structured, and the product concept formalized. The navigable prototype and business plan demonstrate the solution’s feasibility and outline a consistent path for the next phases, including full MVP development, small-scale testing, and business model evolution.
